# Integrated Monitoring Health Platform
2m Foundation, First Place: Global Leadership Institute and Pacific Autism Family Network are centres of excellence and networks of support for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder and their families. Individuals on the autism spectrum are often at risk of experiencing unpredictable epileptic seizures. Therefore, in collaboration with the UBC Cloud Innovation Centre (CIC), a solution has been developed to monitor an individual using wearable and environmental sensors. This platform collects and integrates data from wearable and environmental sensors into a single UI.
